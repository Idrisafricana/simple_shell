Simple Shell Project

Introduction
Welcome to the Simple Shell Project! This project aims to create a basic shell program where users can enter commands for execution. The shell will parse these commands, execute them in child processes, and display the results to the user. This project is a collaborative effort been Idris and Ismail. 

Features
Command Execution: Users can enter various shell commands, and the program will execute them.
Tokenization: User input is tokenized into individual commands and arguments for proper execution.
Error Handling: The shell handles errors such as command not found, fork failure, and memory allocation issues.
User-Friendly Interface: The shell provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
